      <description>Lab Module 3: Shellshock Attack #  Alexander Sullivan
3/04/21
Part One: Overview #  Learning Objective: get first hand experience with the shellshock vulnerability.
We will be experimenting with the actual shellshock attack in this lab. The Shellshock attack was first developed on September 24, 2014, and was a vulnerability within the Bash program.
Part Two: Lab Tasks #  2.1 Experimenting with Bash function #  Bash within Ubuntu 16.</description>
